# Mythic Chairs
This is a port of RKCore_Sit that just had the RKCore stuff removed.


Original :
- [rk-sit](https://github.com/RKCore-Org/rk-sit/)

> NOTE: This has no function to use as it's done through a command I have declared in my base script. Just add the Trigger below to a command or something and it'll work

```
TriggerClientEvent('mythic_chars:client:StartSit', source)
```
